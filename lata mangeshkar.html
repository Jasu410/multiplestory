    <b><u>Childhood & Early Life</u></b>
    <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929 in Indore, Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh).

Her father Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar was an accomplished classical singer and stage actor. Lata was initially named Hema when she was born, but later her father renamed her as Lata, inspired by a character in one of his plays. She had four siblings, three sisters, Meena, Asha and Usha; and one brother, Hridaynath. All five Mangeshkar siblings learned classical music from their father.</p>
