    <b><u>Indira Gandhi: Birth, Family, Education</u></b>
    <p>Indira Gandhi was born on <i>19 November 1917</i>, to <i>Jawaharlal Nehru</i> and Kamala Nehru in Allahabad, India. Her father was the leading freedom fighter and was the first <i>Prime Minister</i> of Independent India. After her younger brother died at an early age, Indira was raised by her mother at Anand Bhawan. When Indira was young, Kamala Nehru died an early death after suffering from tuberculosis. </p>
    <p>Indira was taught by tutors at home and she didn't attend school regularly. She attended Modern School in Delhi, St Cecilia's and St Mary's Christian convent schools in Allahabad, the International School of Geneva, the Ecole Nouvelle in Bex, the Pupils' Own School in Poona and Bombay, Vishwa Bharati in Santiniketan. She left Vishwa Bharti to attend her ailing mother in Europe and continued her education at the University of Oxford. After the death of her mother, she attended the Badminton School and then enrolled at  Somerville College in 1937 to study History. </p>
    <p>When Germany rapidly conquered Europe, Indira tried to return to England via Portugal but was stranded there for two months. In early 1941, she entered England and then returned to India without completing her studies at Oxford. Later, she was awarded an honorary degree by the Oxford University. </p>
    <b><u>Indira Gandhi: Personal Life</u></b>
    <p>When Indira was in Great Britain, she frequently visited her friend and future husband, Feroze Gandhi. They both knew each other from Allahabad. Feroze Gandhi was studying at the London School of Economics. The couple married in 1942 in Allahabad as per Adi Dharm rituals. On August 20, 1944, the couple gave birth to their first son <i>Rajiv Gandhi</i> who later became the youngest Prime Minister of India. On December 11, 1946, the couple gave birth to their second son, Sanjay Gandhi. In 1960, after 18 years of their marriage, Sanjay Gandhi died of a heart attack.</p>
    <b><u>Indira Gandhi: Career in Indian Politics</u></b>
    <p>After her marriage in 1942, Indira Gandhi served her father and the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru unofficially. In the late 1950s, she serves as the President of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru died and she was appointed as a Rajya Sabha member. She served as the Minister of Information and Broadcasting under the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. </p>
    <p>In 1996, after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, she was elected as the leader by the Congress legislative party. </p>
    <p>In January 1966, Indira Gandhi became the first and only female Prime Minister of India to date. Moraji Desai served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister under Indira Gandhi's cabinet. At the beginning of her first term as the Prime Minister, media and opposition parties criticised her as 'Goongi Gudiya'.</p>
    <p>In 1967 General Elections, Congress Party's magic started vanishing due to the widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. For the first time, Congress lost in the majority of states. Despite this, Indira Gandhi managed to win from the  Raebareli constituency and promised to devalue the rupee. The wheat import from the US fell due to political differences. </p>
    <p>In 1969, she faced differences due to her socialist policies. She supported independent candidate  V. V. Giri for the vacant post of President of India, rather than supporting the official Congress party candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.She also announced bank nationalism without consulting the then Finance Minister, Moraji Desai. She nationalised 14 largest banks in India in 1969.  </p>
        <p>On June 25, 1975, Indira Gandhi imposed a 21-month long emergency across India. The proclamation was signed a day before by the then President of India  Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed under Article 352 of the Constitution because of the prevailing internal disturbance. The emergency was withdrawn on March 21, 1977. The emergency allowed the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to rule by decree. The elections, freedom of the press and constitutional rights were suspended.</p>
        <p>During the Emergency, Sanjay Gandhi entered into Indian politics. It is alleged that during Sanjay Gandhi had total control over Indira Gandhi and the government was run by Prime Minister's House rather than the Prime Minister's Office. </p>
        <p>*I have lived a long life, and I am proud that I spend the whole of my life in the service of my people. I am only proud of this and nothing else. I shall continue to serve until my last breath, and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it. [Indira Gandhi].</p><hr>
